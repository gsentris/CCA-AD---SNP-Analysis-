CAIDE score Machine learning 
------------------------
RF_CAIDE_Classifier_CV.py - runs RANDOM forest on CAIDE score

CCA_Rf_Stat_sig.py- runs CCA 
----------------------------------
KERNEL
-----------------------------
KernelCCA_ mvlearn and KernelCCA_ mvlearn_PERM_CV - are used for kernel and one has a different configuration for permutation testing and CV because of false positives that were arising
